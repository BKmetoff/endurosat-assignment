## Task:

Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for a simple web application.

## Steps:

1. Choose a version control system (e.g. Git) and create a new repository.
2. Create a simple web application using a language of your choice (e.g. Python Flask).
3. Create a Dockerfile to containerize the web application.
4. Choose a CI tool (e.g. Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis CI) and set up a new pipeline.
5. Configure the pipeline to listen to the repository for changes, and trigger a build when a new
   commit is made.
6. Build the Docker image, and push it to a container registry (e.g. Docker Hub).
7. Deploy the Docker container to a staging environment (e.g. a Kubernetes cluster) for testing.
8. Configure the pipeline to run automated tests against the deployed application, and fail the build
   if any tests fail.
9. If the tests pass, deploy the Docker container to a production environment.
